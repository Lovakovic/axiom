# CLI Agent Technical Specification

## Core Functionality

The CLI agent provides an interactive terminal interface for users to communicate with an AI agent powered by LangGraph. It continues to deliver streaming responses, graceful interruption management (including a three-stage Ctrl+C mechanism), and robust conversation state preservation.

## Features and Enhancements

1. **Multi-Agent Support**
   - Supports dynamic switching between multiple agents (OpenAI and Anthropic) via the `/switch` command.
   - The Agent Manager reinitializes connections and preserves conversation context after interruptions.

2. **Improved Streaming and State Management**
   - Enhanced stream processing for both text responses and detailed tool execution events.
   - Improved conversation buffer management retains partial responses during interruptions and integrates them seamlessly into subsequent interactions.

3. **Robust Error and Interruption Handling**
   - More resilient error handling during tool invocation and state transitions.
   - A refined reconnection mechanism minimizes state loss after interruptions, ensuring a smooth user experience.

4. **Extended Tool Integration**
   - Additional local tools (e.g., "view-image") now support converting image files to base64 data for inline display.
   - Improved integration with LangGraph for managing tool execution workflows.

5. **Enhanced Logging and Debugging**
   - Expanded logging across all components captures detailed state changes, errors, and tool interactions.

## Technical Implementation Overview

- **Input Management:** Robust input queuing and tracking of processing state to ensure sequential command execution without conflict.

- **Stream Processing:** A structured workflow that cleanly separates text outputs from tool execution details using LangGraph's state machine capabilities.

- **State Management and Recovery:** Reliable preservation of conversation context during interruptions with seamless reconnection to maintain session integrity.

- **Tool Execution:** Dynamic tool invocations with schema validation, supporting both local tools and remote MCP protocol calls.

- **Multi-Agent Architecture:** An enhanced Agent Manager that facilitates switching between OpenAI and Anthropic providers based on task requirements.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Thread Safety and Resource Management:** Ensures orderly handling of user inputs and efficient resource cleanup on exit.

- **User Experience Enhancements:** Provides clear feedback on interruptions, smooth dynamic agent switching, and detailed error messages.

- **Performance and Scalability:** Optimized for efficient stream processing with minimal memory overhead; plans to extend support for remote tool execution in future releases.
